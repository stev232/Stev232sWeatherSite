# Stev232sWeatherSite

## Description

This project is to create a Weather Dashboard that will display the weather for a searched city. This Weather Dashboard utilizes APIs related to Open Weather Map. This site stores previously searched locations to make it more convineant for the user to be able to lookup a city that they've searched in the past. The default city is my home town of Escanaba Michigan.
